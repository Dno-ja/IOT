# IOT
This project presents an IoT solution for monitoring and managing environmental conditions, focusing on temperature and humidity levels. The system integrates advanced sensors, a physical actuator, and an intuitive Node-RED dashboard to provide real-time data visualization, notifications, and predictive insights.


# Project Highlights
## Sensor-Based Monitoring
Accurate measurement of temperature and humidity using state-of-the-art sensors.

## Humidity Index Notifications
Real-time alerts via a physical actuator to categorize humidity levels as:
- Low
- Normal
- High

## Node-RED Dashboard
A user-friendly dashboard for real-time data visualization and device control.

## Predictive Analytics
Analyze historical data and forecast future trends for better decision-making.

# How It Works
# 1.Sensor Integration
Connect temperature and humidity sensors to the IoT system.

# 2.Actuator Notifications
A physical actuator alerts users based on predefined humidity thresholds.

# 3.Node-RED Dashboard
- Monitor environmental conditions in real-time through the dashboard.
- Control connected devices seamlessly.

# 4.Predictive Insights
Leverage predictive analytics for understanding past trends and preparing for future conditions.
